# AI-ML

During the first week, we delved into the fundamentals of deep learning and neural network models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). We examined their structures, real-world uses, and how they are inspired by the functioning of the human brain. Additionally, we outlined and designed the workflow for a forest fire detection project utilizing CNN technology.
